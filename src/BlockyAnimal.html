 Notes to Grader:
  - Earlier steps of the assignment are commented out but preserved to show progression. 
  - Collaboration: I worked with Sam Morrow. We would discuss videos and follow them along together. I also helped him rotating triangles for his drawn image 
  - Used ChatGPT to clarify concepts like rainbow hue to RGB that I used for my rainbow brush.
  - GitHub Copilot occasionally auto-completed parts of this file, but those suggestions were revised as needed.
  - Had ChatGPT format and add comments to some of my code but that would often result in broken code - which I didn't have time to fix. I also asked Copilot to help with the same thing, but I ran out of free Copilot usage before finishing, so files liek ColoredPoints.js are convoluted and poorly commented.
Awesomeness:
  - I added a "Rainbow" brush that acts much like the circle brush, except every triangle that makes it up is a color of the rainbow. It worked sequentially so that the entire rainbow is represented in the circle. Gets better blended the more segments there are.
  - I added a Hexadecimal color display that shows what color the brush is.
  - I added a "Randomize Color" button that randomizes the color sliders.
